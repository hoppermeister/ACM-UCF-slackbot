# ACM at UCF Slack Bot
 
 A simple bot for Slack, primarily the ACM at UCF Slack server.
 
 Built using Node.js

## Installation and Usage

 The bot simply needs an instance of Node.js, internet access, a token for the Slack server, and a key for WeatherUnderground (the weather information provider for the project)
 
 The key and token should be added to example.config.secret.json and it should be renamed "config.secret.json".
 
 To fetch the dependencies for the project you can use npm by navigating to the directory containing the project and using the command "npm install".
 
  Once the key and token have been added and the dependencies installed the bot can be run using the command "node bot.js".
